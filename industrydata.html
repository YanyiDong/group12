                Through the analysis of the data of occupational employers' demands, basic skills and occupational skills given by burning glass, Gary has the idea of changing his ideal career. At first, Gary's ideal job was software developer, but it can be seen from the employer demand data that the demand for this job is decreasing year by year. Gary thinks there are mainly several reasons. The first is that software developers are more independent and focus on individual capabilities. But now, in the 21st century, there is more emphasis on comprehensive strengths and "soft" skills, such as problem-solving, teamwork, communication and so on. Second, teamwork is more effective than individual work. Thirdly, with the progress of science and technology, the function of the software is diversified, which leads to the insufficiency of personal ability to solve the problem. Still, according to the data given by burning glass, Gary analysed the career he wants to change as a software engineer. The first reason is that the employer demand for software engineers is increasing and there are more job opportunities. The second reason is that software engineers are better paid. In addition, software engineers are more likely to work in a team, where they can learn from their partners and improve their professional skills. On the contrary, through this survey, the remaining team members did not change their ideal work. They are still confident in their ideal work and work hard for it. <br><br>
