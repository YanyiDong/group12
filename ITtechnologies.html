    <h1> IT Technologies </h1>
    <h2> Blockchain/Cryptocurrency </h2>
    <p>
      Blockchain and cryptocurrencies lead the way for technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and networking as they control the economic system, known as the Blockchain Economic System. They have characteristics that can be split up into better
      security, efficiency, decentralization, immutability, and transparency. These built in characteristics allow it to increase the trust and integrity of transactions. As of now (2020) blockchain technology is a limited method of digital record
      keeping that allows businesses to share information and data between each other. However, as it creates its digital economic infrastructure over the next estimated 4-6 years, it is predicted that it has enough potential with the help of
      businesses driving it to be worth $360 billion after 6 years. One of areas that is predicted to grow the most is Cybersecurity, which is constantly evolving, meaning that Blockchain will always be relevant and necessary for aspiring businesses
    </p>
    <p>
      Blockchain technology can affect all record-keeping procedures, including:
      - How transactions are initiated, handled, approved, registered and published. Changes to
      - Business models and business procedures can have an impact on back-office operations such as financial statements and tax planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blockchain or cryptocurrency will change everything in the future. The way its going effect is it is going to change the way people use the currency. It might make the currency of the whole world the same currency in every country will be the
      same. The international transaction will become easier. Tourist, international businessman and international students will get a huge benefit from it.
    </p>

    <h2> Autonomous Vehicles </h2>
    <p>
      Electric vehicles and self-driving vehicles are two revolutions which are growing at a highly fast rate. Some say that the introduction to electric cars may be harmful towards the increased power needs, and instead, are recommending
      gas-electric
      hybrids. In terms of self-vehicles, Tesla is currently at level 2 driving automation capabilities. This means that they require a driver at the wheel as well as for them be looking out for traffic and potential hazards at all times. Most, if
      not
      all major car manufacturers have attempted to dive into the research of self-driving vehicles, with two of the biggest aspects determining how useful and advanced they are, the first one being how far it can drive, and the second one being how
      reliant it is on a human driver because of a fault in the computer. It is predicted that fully self-driving vehicles will be ready in 12-16 years, with level 3 being predicted in the upcoming years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although recent studies of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) have examined the economic costs and environmental impacts of this technology, little is known about how SAVs can alter urban structures , especially by reducing the need for the
      parking. Simulation findings show that we could be able to remove up to 90% of parking demand for consumers who implement the method on a low price. At a poor consumer penetration rate of 2%. The findings also indicate that different SAV
      activity
      strategies and consumer preferences can contribute to different spatial distribution of urban parking demand.

    <p>
      The self-driving car will be available in the future. the way it is going to affect my lifestyle by taking away the freedom of driving my self.people might become lazy because by pressing a button the car will take them to their destination. On
      the other hand, it will help a lot of people by taking away the burden of driving like elderly people, ambulant people and also people with severe illness.
    </p>

    <h2> Machine Learning </h2>
    <p>
      Machine learning is applied within many applications in today’s technology with people not taking much notice towards. This can include self-driving cars, online data collection, and cybersecurity, more specifically, fraud detection. One of the
      biggest integrations machine learning has with complementary technologies are with blockchains. The security aspects of blockchain is important when using the analysis side of machine learning. This allows financial services to keep their data
      secure and to be able to process and store their data extremely efficiently. A large aspect in the future of machine learning, is improved unsupervised algorithms, that is, the ability for AI to analyse datasets and make predictions based on
      the inputs. This will allow them to identify hidden patterns or groupings which would not have been possible with supervised algorithms. Many companies are also attempting to integrate quantum computers into machine learning to allow them to
      harness the processing speeds in combination with machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      By analysing comparable innovations of the technological, technical and AI revolutions, this essay suggests that the latter is aimed and that it will bring in extensive improvements that would also impact all areas of our culture and life. In
      addition, its effect on businesses and jobs would be important, culminating in richly interlinked organisations of decision-making based on research and exploitation of “big” data and intensified, global competition among firms. People will be
      able to order goods and access services from everywhere in the world using the Internet and to make use of the infinite potential opportunities that will be given up with the extensive use of AI technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machine Learning is the future. Nowadays AI is taking control of almost everything we do in our daily life. From our TV to our car navigation AI is there. The way AI is going to Impact my life is it will digitalize my life on a different level.
      But also, on the other hand, it will make a lot of people lose there life.
    </p>

    <h2> Cloud Computing </h2>
    <p>
      The benefits of cloud computing are the ability to keep an infrastructure running efficiently and effectively. Currently, cloud computing allows businesses to deliver computing services such as networks, software, storage, etc at a flexible and
      high speed. They also have built-in security to protect their data and applications, as well as being able to recover lost data using data backups. An aspect in the future of cloud computing, is the increased options towards education, as
      people seeking knowledge will be able to access classes from any location. Many possibilities will be unlocked with the assistance of 5G, as it will help leverage the technological advances such as spanning data through multiple public,
      private, and hybrid clouds. It is predicted that within the next 15 years, smaller companies will investing in computer towers and servers as a workstation towards employees, whilst keeping the same appearance and functions consistent. This
      also reinforces the cybersecurity aspect of a company in terms of the security of computers and applications whilst also keeping all firmware up-to date.
</p>
<p>
      Cloud Computing (CC) as a philosophy and market opportunity is expected to see more credit crunch companies adopt the comparatively low cost promise of CC to ensure continued economic stability and longevity. The pay-as-you-go framework of the
      CC business model is usually tailored to small and medium-sized companies that do not have the capacity to adequately fulfil their IT specifications. Private end-users will also be looking to leverage the colossal pool of services that CC is
      promising in an effort to provide mobile freedom of access. However, as with many resources that give legal users tremendous benefits, unscrupulous and fraudulent users would often attempt to leverage CC to manipulate the weaknesses that could
      remain within this new definition, architecture and business model.
</p>
<p>
      Cloud computing has a positive effect on corporate enterprises as it raises their income and helps them meet business objectives. Companies tend to use cloud providers rather than develop their networks. The way it is going to affect my life is
      if I establish a business in the future it will help me to develop my business
