                I think during our group assignment, we did well in terms of content, as we have a good level of understanding of our information and hit most, if not all of the recommended word counts. Time management was definitely an issue as we were rushed during the last couple of days, however might not have been the case as Krithigan and I joined the group less than a week before the deadline. One thing that surprised me was the level of detail in our project idea, as I didn’t have much input towards that section. One thing that I learned about groups is how much we can get done within a certain amount of time, as long as we have good communication. Because we did our content then added it to the github afterwards, it meant that we didn’t need too many pull requests which means we don’t have too many log of activities because we pretty much did it in a couple goes.

                Throughout the entire group project, I personally feel as though we as a group have accomplished multiple tasks and have scheduled multiple meetings in order to complete the assignment with finesse. This meant that each member of the group was in accordance with the task that they were assigned, which made the flow of the group assessment easier. However, mild improvements could have been made to further completing the assignment quicker and more efficiently. Coming up with the project idea as a group was interesting, as well as, after completion of the IT Works part of the project, I have understood the position and work done by IT professionals on a daily basis. Communication and collaboration should be the most crucial part of working in a group, as things could be misinterpreted or misunderstood.

                Despite the addition of two new team members, we were able to communicate quickly and begin to assign assignment 2 tasks. In the whole process, the communication between members is very close, and the problems raised in the meeting can be solved quickly. In the process of completing the ideal job, I learned about your different career ideals and summarized them. In the project idea completed with Yanyi Dong, we brainstormed once and created our project after detailed discussion with team members based on our own development of the IT industry.

            <p class="p1">
                Since I was only added a few days before the assignment due date it was a bit difficult for me to learn who was doing what and how everyone was working. As time went on it became clear of what was happening, the thing that went well for us was that we all knew what to do and how to do even me within a few days. So finishing my part before the due date wasn’t that difficult.  We can improve on using GitHub and at least for me just having a bit more time with the group to understand everyone and how they work. I was surprised to see how well we worked with the short time we had. It’s easy to track the edits and errors from the activity logs. Overall it was all okay.

                In this group project, the team members cooperated with each other to successfully complete the group work. Through this group work, I think I still have a lot to improve. I realized the importance of communication, an efficient meeting can make us what we need to do. In this regard, I agree more with the ideas of the group members. I think I should put forward my own views or ideas more, maybe my ideas will also inspire some group members. In this group assignment, my part is industry data and the project idea completed in cooperation with Oliver.

                During work on assignment 2, all the members of group 12 were cooperative and helped each other with all the work. The most challenging work was to upload everything to GitHub. Also, new members were added to the group later on but they managed to catch up with everything. After the new members were added to our group new tasks were assigned to all the members which everyone followed and worked hard on. In the end, everyone was able to finish their work on time and did a group meeting to elaborate on everything before doing the final submission.
