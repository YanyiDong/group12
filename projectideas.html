        <h1> Project Ideas </h1>

        <h3>Overview：</h3>
        <p class="p1"> 
            Our group hopes to do a project about online shopping, but it is different from the usual online shopping platform. Our group considers that we can replace 2D images with 3D images of products, so that customers can observe more details of products and bring more convenience to their purchase. At the same time, we also hope to be able to use AR technology, so that users can see what they wear when they buy some special products, such as shoes or clothes. Moreover, our group thinks that we can also try to change the logistics mode, so that the logistics efficiency is greatly reduced, and customers can get their favorite goods faster.
        </p>

        <h3>Motivation：</h3>
        <p class="p1">
            With the rapid development of science and technology, people's way of shopping is also quietly changing. When the Internet did not develop, people would go to the store to purchase the products they needed. However, this way has many disadvantages. First of all, it is very inconvenient. The commuting time in the store may increase due to traffic problems. At the same time, people can't compare the goods with other businesses to find the products with higher cost performance. And then the emergence of online shopping has changed people's shopping methods greatly, and easy assembled solutions to these questions makes more people choose online shopping because of its convenience and high cost performance. In a recent social survey, 60% of people choose online shopping, because they think online shopping is efficient and convenient. Online shopping only needs to complete a complete set of transaction processes such as selecting goods and online payment through the Internet. Without going to the physical store, a transaction can be completed in a few minutes, saving time and effort, convenient and fast. <br><br>

        <h3>Description：</h3>

        <h2>1. 3D scanning function; <br></h2>
        <p class="p1">
            We hope that there will be a 3D scanning function in the software. Businesses can scan and sell goods through this function in our software, so as to obtain the 3D model of the product and upload it to the product details page for customers to view. Compared with the traditional 3D and 3D models, the products can be displayed in a multi-dimensional, multi-dimensional and multidimensional way. Generally speaking, the 3D display of commodities has the characteristics of visibility, interactivity, diversity, entertainment, and fast transmission speed. At the same time, our team also thinks that our 3D display function can be combined with other functions to improve the high degree of customization and shopping efficiency; <br><br>

            (1) 3D product display + hot spots <br><br>
            For electronic products, artworks and other needs to display product size, embedded operation video, detailed pictures, text introduction and other operations, you can add hot functions, so that each function and detail of the product can be displayed perfectly. <br><br>

            (2) Product 3D display + map replacement <br><br>
            If the materials, colors and patterns of automobiles, furniture and daily products need to be changed, the function of replacing mapping can be added. The appearance of each part of the product can be changed with one key. What you see is what you get, which gives consumers more space to choose and match. <br><br>

            (3) Product 3D display + part replacement <br><br>
            When there are multiple choices for a certain part of furniture, shoe bag, home decoration and other products, the position replacement function can be set, so that each style of parts can be assembled on the product, what you see is what you get, and the real-time overall matching effect can be seen. <br><br>

            (4) Product 3D display + specific animation <br><br>
            Cosmetics, furniture, home appliances, cars and other products often need to open, close, and run functions. At this time, specific animation can be added to realize the automatic opening or one button opening of products, and the information will be completely and accurately conveyed to consumers in the shortest time. <br><br>

            (5) Product 3D display + text customization <br><br>
            In the shoe bag, clothing, luxury goods and other industries, consumers prefer to customize some words to express special meaning and emotion. Therefore, 3D provides the text customization function of the product. Consumers can display the text on the product by inputting text, so as to add more emotional value to the product. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>2. The support of AR technology; <br></h2>
        <p class="p1">
            Due to the limitation of traditional e-commerce information display methods, commodity information display is very incomplete. On the basis of 3D technology, our group thinks that we can combine AR technology with it to change our shopping mode. The combination of AR technology and e-commerce can realize scene interaction and directly view the placement effect of products in the real scene. When businesses can accurately provide the most important information related to products, and allow you to visualize and eliminate them realistically in your own space The fee taker will quickly accept the experience. But customers can only do this with devices that support AR applications, such as mobile phones and tablets. <br><br>

            In the app, we will set an AR function. When customers use this function, the system will input the scene environment through the camera of mobile phone or tablet computer and present it on the screen, so that customers can try and interact with products in any environment, so as to realize the most important attributes of products to some extent. For example, the size is usually the most important for furniture, such as texture or luster The details are more important to clothes. So for the following specific types of goods, our group has different ideas; <br><br>
            
            (1)Furniture; by using this function, consumers can visualize the display effect of a piece of furniture at home and then place an order without going to the physical store. <br><br>
            
            (2)Beauty and make-up; by using this function, consumers can feel the new modeling effect brought by different colors or cosmetics. <br><br>
            
            
            (3)Cars; There is not enough space for car dealers to display all the products and various configurations. An augmented reality based sales experience can help fill this gap. Through the AR function, it helps consumers to customize the configuration and further understand the parts and functions of each vehicle model. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>3. Change of logistics mode (excluding customized goods);</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            The traditional logistics mode and process is that the merchant sends the goods to the customer directly according to the order address, which leads to a phenomenon that is hard to avoid. The distance between the merchant and the consumer's address is very far, which leads to the long logistics time. So our team members came up with a way to set up a commodity warehouse in the center of a highly developed large city to radiate to the surrounding cities. After the consumer places an order, the system will search the nearest commodity warehouse of the consumer, and call the database to search for the goods and send them. <br><br>

            (1)   As the goods are sent out from the nearest commodity warehouse of consumers, the logistics distance is greatly reduced, so the logistics time will be correspondingly reduced. <br><br>

            (2)   At the same time, because the commodity warehouse is set up around the highly developed large cities, its transportation mode is very diversified, and the transportation network is also highly perfect, so the logistics efficiency will increase correspondingly. <br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Tools and Technologies <br></h3>   

        <h2>Simpleware <br></h2>
        <p class="p1">
            The 3D printing process is a global advanced technology in recent decades. It is different from the "removal method" of traditional cutting and other materials. Additive  technology will use the stacking of fine raw material layers to generate three-dimensional entities, so it is commonly called "3D “Printing” can also be understood as a stack of countless 2D printing planes. This process does not require traditional tools, molds, lathes and complex processes, and can quickly produce designs into real objects. The basis of 3D printing is to build a three-dimensional model of a product. The quality of the three-dimensional model has a decisive influence on the quality of the final product. Therefore, three-dimensional modeling technology is particularly important for presenting physical models of objects. <br><br>

            Based on the rapid development of imaging technology and computer technology, complex objects can be reconstructed and modeled more accurately through scanning images of objects. The construction of complex models makes 3D printing more widely used. China imitates Simpleware software, which is committed to providing world-leading 3D image processing, analysis, modeling and services for CAD, CAE and 3D printing, and has been widely adopted by the industry worldwide. Zhongyi Technology participated in the 2014 National Radiographic Digital Imaging and CT New Technology Symposium on the theme of the new application of industrial CT in the field of 3D printing. It introduced in detail the image-based 3D modeling function of Simpleware software and discussed Simpleware’s development in the field of 3D printing. The application was introduced in detail and case operation,  and was unanimously approved by the participants. Simpleware software has the function of 3D processing of scanned images. Its powerful and accurate modeling function converts scanned images of objects into realistic 3D models. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>VS code <br></h2>
        <p class="p1"> VS code has the following three main advantages: <br><br>

            1. Lightweight editor <br><br>
            VS code is a lightweight editor, the installation package is very small, and the startup speed is very fast. Although this is not very helpful to the actual project, it can improve our user experience invisibly. <br><br>

            2. Rich plug-in system <br><br>
            VS code has a very rich plug-in system, whether you are editing HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Vue, React and other front-end code, or JAVA, Python and other back-end code. We can all find the corresponding plug-in, which allows us to complete the project more quickly. <br><br>

            3. Code tracking function <br><br>
            We are a team, and projects are often developed collaboratively. In most cases, we need to use Git to manage our code. At this time, VS code will track our code and clearly mark us: you have changed those files. You can modify the first few lines of code so that we can see the code we wrote at a glance. <br><br>
           
            In addition to these two tools, in the process of designing the UI, we will also use Photoshop and Illustrator. <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Skills Required <br></h3>
        <p class="p1">
            Before we do this project, we need to get these following skills: When making APP web pages, HTML and CSS are required. At the same time, JavaScript and SQL are also basic requirements. These skills can make the APP have a fully functional web page, which is also the most basic as an app. This is also a good way for everyone to download it. Secondly, in terms of code, we think we need to master ASP.Net, PHP and JSP. In addition, we also need to understand the database and related knowledge, how to use SQL server or other software. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Outcome <br></h3>
        <p class="p1">
            The purpose of this software is to allow people to find friends while exercising. Team exercise can maximize our communication skills. The function of holding small competitions allows more people to exercise their abilities through actual combat. Generally speaking, a person's highest level can often be played in actual combat. The setting of professional competition mode can improve people's team ability. As people know, team ability is a very important ability now. The personal assistance training mode will enable some novices to get help and prevent them from making mistakes for not understanding this activity. In general, this application solves the idea of most people wanting to participate in sports together. At the same time, this app also has its own circle of friends just like social software. Here people can share their experiences and photos. <br><br><br><br>
