            <h2 class="p1">
                For this part of the report, we have interviewed an IT professional to gather in-depth information on the kind of work done by IT professionals. The interviewee works as a senior service delivery manager/project manager that is responsible for the availability and uptime of systems and the services being delivered to consumers and employees.  <br><br>
                
                Our interviewee works in the government sector for the utilities industry, mainly focuses on the water utility. As a senior manager, other than managing the availability and uptime of systems,  our interviewee manages and delivers projects, writes business cases, looks at process improvements and IT maturity which helps support and deliver quality services in the company and to consumers. The people that IT professionals interact with in their daily work consist of the heads of departments or general managers, for example CEO’s, CIO’s, so the senior leadership teams are the usual stakeholders that the interviewee interacts with daily. <br><br>
                
                Moreover, our interviewee has been in contact and have interacted with other IT professionals in the past. For instance, the interviewee has worked with mentor management and other support teams within the organisation as well as other companies from all kinds of industry, such as big players like Deloitte, KPMG, to boutique consulting companies and the members of that. In a utility company, IT professionals often do not have direct interactions with external customers as such, only with the internal business teams and the investors are the government organizations so there are really no investors. Our interviewee spends the majority of its time identifying problems and solving them under the premises that are business critical or delivery critical and figuring out how to immediate a problem and the situation with effective working ways. The most challenging tasks for IT professionals are often the people. Getting everyone by and shifting people’s work mindset in a different fashion, cooperating and interacting with people from different teams.
