        <h2 >Liam Nugyen 'Network security consultant'</h2>
        <p>
            Through my understanding, this job position investigates security breaches and figures out ways to be able to improve the security of a business and reduce the amount of cyber risk. This appeals to me The skills required for this position is to be able to not only communicate, but to also be able to develop relationships with customers to ensure services at high quality, which sounds like what this job post works towards   evidently through under the key responsibilities shown on the website: “Carry out hunting activities, investigate anomalies and, security event and incident investigations”, “Participates in Red and Blue team activities”, “Proactively identify, prevent and respond to security events and incidents”.  <br><br>

        <h2>Wai Hoe Fan 'Game Design'</h2>
        <p>
            In this day and age, individuals such as myself who was born into today's technological improving world have been exposed to large amounts of technology ever since I was a kid. IT was a very facinating thing to me as a kid, therefore I took interest into it while I was first introduced to it. My brother was the cause to my interest into IT as I got hooked into the visuals and appeals of a game. I was around the age of 10 when I was first introduced to what a game truly was. The competitive energy while playing the game was suprisingly addictive which was the main reason that peeked my interest. The reason I chose to come to RMIT was because of its convenience in the city and its business courses. I expect to learn to become more mature in the sense of knowledge, and to be more aware of my own abilities.  <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Yanyi Dong 'Program Developer'</h2>
        <p>
            I would like to do this job because the job is accountable for Design and develop messaging/chat software with the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Also, Contributing system analysis, solution (functional & technical) design and feasibility activities.those two reasons makes me choose this job. In my mind, I belives that the workplace and university is a similar thing, it both makes people acquire knowledge. Just a part of people can’t understand that.they just make money by the workplace. This job can let me get a lot of knowledge about AI and software testing. meanwhile, it has a good income.  <br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Yuqing Wu 'Algorithm Engineer'</h2>
        <p>
            Algorithm engineers use algorithms to solve problems. Different algorithms may be used to solve different problems. Algorithm engineers need to write the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem. Algorithm engineers can combine with artificial intelligence to make the deep learning of artificial intelligence more efficient. The most important thing is that artificial intelligence will be the future development direction of information technology. And the average salary of an algorithm engineer is higher than other occupations. <br>

        <h2>Summary </h2>
        <p>
            The above is the ideal job of each member of our team. Through comparison, we can find that all the ideal jobs can be roughly divided into two parts. <br><br>

            ’E-commerce ',' program developer 'and' game design 'need to combine the front-end development with the back-end development, and pay attention to the user's experience while realizing the functions. In the development of a software, we need to use the back-end logic code to achieve some specific functions, such as the transfer function of an E-commerce platform or the function of adding friends to chat software. With the rapid development of it, people pay more and more attention to the closeness of human-computer interaction while pursuing the diversification of software functions. Users communicate with the system through the human-computer interaction interface and operate. Our team agreed that the design of excellent human-computer interaction interface has a good and huge impact on the usability or user friendliness of the system, which is obviously reflected in the "game design". On the basis of the realization of game functions, excellent game story lines and exquisite game pictures can make players immersed in the game. The physical feedback in the game, such as touch, sound effect and visual effects, can bring players a sense of freshness and stimulation, making the designed game more attractive. In general, we believe that the ultimate goal of this profession, which needs to combine front-end and back-end development, is to provide users with the best user experience. <br><br>

            While 'Algorithm Developer' and 'Network Security Consultant' pay more attention to the back-end development, and have little connection with the front-end, the two professions are also quite different. We believe that "Algorithm Developer" is the foundation of program function realization. Programmers can improve the efficiency of code implementation by using different logic programming languages, and reduce the bugs caused by the miscellaneous programming languages. For example, when sorting a large amount of data, different algorithms have different effects on sorting time and sorting efficiency. Algorithm developers need to find the most suitable and efficient algorithm. Compared with algorithm developer, network security consultant is to find network back-end vulnerabilities to protect computer security. In the past century, the Internet has been developing at a high speed. This trend will only increase but not decrease. This phenomenon makes network security become an important issue, such as the famous Snowden incident. This profession is to encrypt and transmit data through various encryption methods, such as "symmetric key cryptography method". At the same time, this profession needs to check the back-end code to find the loopholes in the computer firewall, so as to protect the computer from property losses caused by virus infection. In a word, our group believes that the purpose of this kind of occupation is to improve the efficiency and security of computers. <br><br>

            However, it is undeniable that the ultimate goal of it is to provide the best user experience to everyone and help people solve the problems that take a long time or even can not be solved in their life. <br><br><br>
